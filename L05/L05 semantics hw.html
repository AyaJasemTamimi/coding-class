                    <p>
                        Dogs have a sense of time but don’t understand the ‘concept’ of time.
                        Unlike humans, dogs don’t have the ability to create actual measures of time,
                        like the second, hour, and minute, and they don’t know how to read clocks.
                        So, telling them ”I’ll be back in 15 minutes” won’t really do much, but we understand
                        that you feel like you have to do it anyway! Dogs are capable of being trained based on
                        past events, and can be taught to anticipate future events based on past experiences.
                        Pavlov’s dogs are the perfect example of this.

                        The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog,
                        it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the modern wolf is the dog's
                        nearest living relative. Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by
                        hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture.

                    <h2>Facts About Cats</h2>
                    <p>
                        Cats can tell when things usually happen, but they don’t actually know what time is.
                        They don’t understand hours or minutes like people do.
                        Instead, they notice patterns like when the sun rises,
                        when the house gets noisy, or when you always feed them. 
                        That’s how they learn to expect dinner at the same time every day, even without a clock!

                        The cat is a small, furry animal that comes from wildcats.
                        Long ago, wildcats started living near people because there were lots of mice to eat.
                        People liked having them around, so they stayed. Over time, they became the house cats we know today,
                        but they still have some of their wild habits, like hunting and climbing.

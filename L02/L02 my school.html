       <h2>Al-Mazniayeh School</h2> 

       <p> 
        My school is<b> Al-Mazniayeh School</b> in <i>Ein-Sara Street, Hebron.</i> <br>
         I like the strategic way it is placed because it is close to my house,<br>
          which makes it easy for me to get there every day.<br>
        The number of students is around <b>700</b> wich consistsof girls only.
       </p>

       <p> The school day starts at <i>8:00</i> in the morning and ends at <i>1:30</i> in the afternoon. <br>
        We study many subjects, such as <mark>Arabic, English, Math, Science, Islamic studies, Technology, and History.</mark> <br>
         Sometimes, we also have art classes and PE.
